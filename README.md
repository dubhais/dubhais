Hello, I am Colin, a coder at the School of Code's bootcamp.

I have pair programmed with 12 members of my cohort for a week each. At the end of every week we have a hackathon challenge to complete. I have also completed a week long challenge with a group of 3 other bootcampers, where we planned, coded, tested, presented and develoyed a full stack app.

In January I will begin a month long project with a group of bootcampers where we will aim to deliver an app.
