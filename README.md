Hello, I am Colin, a student at the School of Code's Frontend bootcamp.

I will start on 26th September and due to finish on 2nd February 2023.

On Twitter I am <a href="https://twitter.com/@falsestartcoder">@falsestartcoder</a>, so called because I have tried to start coding before but always somehow get stuck when it comes to committing to larger projects. I see this course as a way to get out of, for want of a better phrase, tutorial hell.
